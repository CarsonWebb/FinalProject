    "## Introduction\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to model the popularity of songs on Spotify, and look at what features are most likely to lead to a songs overall popularity. To acheive this we will use a variety of different regression models, both linear and non-linear. We will also be looking at the effectiveness of these models when used on such a large database to determine which model is best suited for this task and similar ones."

    "## About the data\n",
    "The dataset was pulled from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devdope/900k-spotify, and contains many different features such as Artist, emotion, Genres, Tempo, with Popularity being our target value. The dataset says it contains 900K+ songs, however the .csv file we will be using has a little under 500K songs. An imprtant feature to note about this dataset is that the emotion feature was generated by an emotion detection model, and it is uncertain how accurate this model was in predicting emotions. It is also unclear how the dataset score the popularity of a song."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Overall none of the models acheived a high R2 score, however the non-linear Regression models like Random forest and Gradient boosting preformed significantly better than the linear regression models. The overall low R2 scores can likely be attributed to the overall low correlation between the target feature and the other features in the dataset. This result makes sense as I beleive that there are many unquantifiable characteristics of a song that could determine ones popularity."

    "## Impact\n",
    "The overall impact of this Project shows how the best feature for predicting the popularity of a song would be whether its good for parties, but even that is a poor overall predictor. This project also shows how with a large and complex dataset like this one, linear regression falls short of other regression models."
